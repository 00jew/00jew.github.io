<p><strong>718pm.gmt</strong></p>

<pre><code>
im calling out
today is not the day
for pulling punches

</code></pre>

<p>heading to campus to return that sata cable to kent</p>

<p>spent the morning on hunter&rsquo;s couch listening and watchin my tunes</p>

<p>just generally frozen in place this morning</p>

<p>I have so many options I need to take</p>

<p>I feel so bad I haven&rsquo;t gotten a trackphone to call my mom</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to definitely alteast call today, there&rsquo;s just not an easy way to get to a walmart cause the bay is too lit for walmart but that&rsquo;s the right price</p>

<p>in the city flip phones were over aHundo everywhere IIII I I III I I II II I II  I III II I I I I I looked</p>

<p>will find david dunn today and edit audio in his room but don&rsquo;t plan on bugging him too much - I really need to hear this sample of a viola de amor he played for me but didn&rsquo;t know he was being recorded</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve recorded him so many times he prolly knew and definitely doesn&rsquo;t care cause he&rsquo;s too smart to care ||||</p>

<p>listened to a lot of my music and now again on this new song</p>

<p>3PAC 0HOOTS is dead, a hybrid between a breakup song and this idea that I have a friend I didn&rsquo;t meet in this life but look forward to being friends in the next, among other things - it&rsquo;s not done but I will go straight to the pianos on campus right now and want to practice it. I want to play it in the city sometime, do an antifolk acoustic piano sing song set || cause I love piano</p>

<p>but I can&rsquo;t sing but I can write and I can regimitize and this juul is about to die thank god half a pod is enough for me</p>

<p><strong>827PM.gmt</strong></p>

<p>just got to SC roasters briconomu drove me and we hit campus but I forot the cable to return then just realized I did fucking have it so anyways going to cut some audio and dream today and I wanna eat but everything is so expensive and I don&rsquo;t have a girlfriend to pay for everything anymore cause I can&rsquo;t do that anymore cause it&rsquo;s fucking my music and damn I feel so bad about it</p>

<p>but atleast we&rsquo;re on talking terms I thought she would hate my guts and cut everything off, maybe she will</p>

<p>also don&rsquo;t read poliwat if you fucking know me
it will drive you crazy</p>

<pre><code>this a brain dump
don't look into it
unless you're by yourself
with an intimate one
</code></pre>

<p>ak fucked the monogamy out of me</p>

<p>i feel so bad she picked me up we got coffee and I am so sad
she was crying and a homeless version of me told her to smile downtown</p>

<p>but thank god I got my mouse</p>

<p>ableton is all I need now</p>

<p>and zoom brew best brew I need 3
but lets see what happens with 1</p>

<pre><code>
im highly transparent
highly cryptic

<h1 id="stop-reading-poliwat">stop reading poliwat</h1>

<h6 id="and-if-you-do">and if you do</h6>

<p>you need to go ahead and not ask direct
questions unless they showed you gave it some thought
or subtle references when we&rsquo;re talking
I love that
and that&rsquo;s one of the reasons I can keep going</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to share too much and see where the cards fall</p>

<p>cause I&rsquo;m not trying to live a long life
and I don&rsquo;t just get by
havven&rsquo;t lived like that in so long I don&rsquo;t even remember
what it feels like
cause even with not knowing how to procure my next meal
I am happy
full of joy
in this world
I love the earth this life this time so much
and I feel so lucky to experience it</p>

<p>just set fire to your life
cause I&rsquo;m a double sign
don&rsquo;t believe it les sit works for me
one of the points of believing
in the first place i need to stop writing but you&rsquo;re not here
and there&rsquo;s a real need to stop writing about how you&rsquo;re not here</p>

<p>but 3PAC 0HOOTS is dead
a friend I never met
I&rsquo;ll meet in the next</p>

<p>something to look forward to</p>

<p>OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK today I&rsquo;m making singsong.poliwat lOL OLOLOL ahahahahahaahahaha going to get that going now cause it&rsquo;s not working in the av logs it&rsquo;s to crazy but I&rsquo;ll make a subdomain for the relative &lsquo;final&rsquo; versions of song lyrics/progressions</p>

<p>cause when I write a song I&rsquo;m writing one instance of it
I like the idea of multiple instances of variations of the same song</p>

<p>and the same song would mean that is some encapsulated idea over a dicrete period of time.</p>

<p>and that&rsquo;s how I sleep</p>

<p>was able to get a good nights sleep last night for the first time in a while</p>

<p>cause the room was spinning when I shut my eyes</p>

<p>It was strangely appealing to get so much sleep</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s been a while at this point since I&rsquo;ve had it</p>

<p>but 3PAC 0HOOTS is dead</p>

<p>played on loop I sing it man</p>

<p>almost done with that then I got the martin track</p>

<p>those will be the first ones on the subdomain</p>

<p>the rest will follow</p>

<p>cause I&rsquo;m coming up on zoom brew</p>

<p>and 3PAC 0HOOTS is dead</p>

<p>but fuck we both know that&rsquo;s not the move but it&rsquo;s the move I wanna do</p>

<p>I should really finish this job app killswitch</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s the only point of conenetion</p>

<p>I feel in my bones the rest is no stress</p>

<p>I have a patron now</p>

<p>feel it in every step</p>

<p>I will keep going until I fall</p>

<p>already gone too hard I cannot stop</p>

<p>this love in my heart if only I could</p>

<p>be more consistent less disapointing</p>

<p>with the exs in my life</p>

<p>but I find the time</p>

<p>to write her songs in due time</p>

<p>cause 3PAC 0HOOTS is dead</p>

<p>that mantra gets me going friend</p>

<p>3PAC || 0HOOTS || is dead</p>
