      <description>too many phones kickback by POLIW.AT  ^ callback - no access to a way to fix the mixing but &amp;lt;3 it regardless
 839AM
on BART heading from fremont to Ashby to see jack
briconomu dropped me off at the surgery section of the hospital and I took a clean shit
I look over grown and worn, but the people on the bart were overly nice to me when I asked for directions.</description>
